I have been involved in this dispute with UMBank since XX/XX/XXXX. Each time they ask for the same paperwork because they can't keep track of the paperwork I have sent them. I have submitted paperwork substantiating my claim for a refund. Each time they say they don't have the paperwork so I send it again. How can a company refuse a refund when they can't keep track of documentation supporting the dispute. \\n\\nI had a year contract with XXXX I sent UMBank specific documentation of what services I received during that time period and what services had not been received. I sent them the signed contract, letters, invoices, FTC paperwork etc. The proof they have that I was misled lied to and cheated out of {$35000.00} is more than sufficient to prove I am not liable for the charge to my UMBank card for {$16000.00}. \\n\\nThank you for looking into this matter.

My contract was good until XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX the FTC of XXXX shut down XXXX because it was a scam. UMBank Credit card services contacted the merchant and the merchant responded that they would not refund me the money. \\n\\nWhen the FTC shuts down a company they freeze all the money of that business. The merchant could not refund my money even if they wanted to because of the freeze on all their accounts. \\n\\nI was not asking for the merchant to refund the money I was asking UMBank to refund the money. I have been involved in this dispute with UMBank since XX/XX/XXXX. Each time they ask for the same paperwork because they can't keep track of the paperwork I have sent them. I have submitted paperwork substantiating my claim for a refund. Each time they say they don't have the paperwork so I send it again. How can a company refuse a refund when they can't keep track of documentation supporting the dispute. \\n\\nI had a year contract with XXXX I sent UMBank specific documentation of what services I received during that time period and what services had not been received. I sent them the signed contract, letters, invoices, FTC paperwork etc. The proof they have that I was misled lied to and cheated out of {$35000.00} is more than sufficient to prove I am not liable for the charge to my UMBank card for {$16000.00}. \\n\\nThank you for looking into this matter. I still have {$35000.00} of debt because what XXXX taught me, made me absolutely no money, but got me further into debt. \\n\\nThank you so much\",\n          \"A hard Inquiry was placed on my Credit Reports by these companies without my knowledge. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX.

My contract was good until XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX the FTC of XXXX shut down XXXX because it was a scam. UMBank Credit card services contacted the merchant and the merchant responded that they would not refund me the money. \\n\\nWhen the FTC shuts down a company they freeze all the money of that business. The merchant could not refund my money even if they wanted to because of the freeze on all their accounts. \\n\\nI was not asking for the merchant to refund the money I was asking UMBank to refund the money. I have been involved in this dispute with UMBank since XX/XX/XXXX. Each time they ask for the same paperwork because they can't keep track of the paperwork I have sent them. I have submitted paperwork substantiating my claim for a refund. Each time they say they don't have the paperwork so I send it again. How can a company refuse a refund when they can't keep track of documentation supporting the dispute. \\n\\nI had a year contract with XXXX I sent UMBank specific documentation of what services I received during that time period and what services had not been received. I sent them the signed contract, letters, invoices, FTC paperwork etc. The proof they have that I was misled lied to and cheated out of {$35000.00} is more than sufficient to prove I am not liable for the charge to my UMBank card for {$16000.00}. \\n\\nThank you for looking into this matter. I still have {$35000.00} of debt because what XXXX taught me, made me absolutely no money, but got me further into debt. \\n\\nThank you so much\",\n          \"A hard Inquiry was placed on my Credit Reports by these companies without my knowledge. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX.
